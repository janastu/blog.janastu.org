# Anthillhacks 22.23 Bamboo tower, LokaLR, Mesh network and that loop

**Anthillhacks 22.23, iruWay ola, Devarayanadurga foothills area near Tumkur, India**

*AntHill is a **metaphor** for the world of structure and complexity that exists just beneath the **surface** of everything around us. And Ants are our inspiration - embodies co-operation, coordination and communication as core principles of building communities.*

"A 'C O W' by Bhavya, Rithika, Shalini and Tania by Bamboo tower"

***Imagine** groups of people from different domains **living** together for a period of time.. The idea of Anthillhacks is to be **inclusive** of city folks, of village folks, of women and non-binary, of educated and the **low-literate** to get to participate and be together.* [Anthillhacks 2015 - <https://j.mp/myhill>]

Traditional bread making with songs dedicated to vistors.

*The **location** itself brings about an intermingling of **thought**-systems that would not have **interacted** otherwise. This inspires collaborations giving birth to eye-opening new productions and curation of existing **narratives** and **annotations** of real world **objects** at the location.* (We released a [3D proceedings of event](anthill.janastu.org)).

**COWMesh**, the Wifi-mesh set up here, **covers** some villages, forest areas, historic sites and the hack camps. Servers and **services** are deployed **locally** on the mesh. Vast **no signal** region incentivises trekking in **forest** or to a **lake** for sessions while keeping connected to the **villages** of the event as a whole.

**Anthillhacks 22.23 is APC supported research and campaign activity to prototype infrastructure for meaningful community connectivity.**

Representation from traditional groups at anthillhacks gave a glimpse of what it takes to imagine sustainable and equitable future ecosystems. Handmaking from natural material, traditional storytelling using scrolls, inclusive gender identities were present as *background music*..

..while participants worked on mesh-technologies, services and mapped the resources with local communities.

### dWebCamp meets Anthillhacks

Anthillhacks 22.23 took to a new turn as some participants from dWebCamp flowed into Anthillhacks activities. Towards the end of dWebCamp, Hiure and Tania agreed to visit for a 3 month residency working on **opening openWRT** and **traffic negotiations** in a context of community networks like COWMesh. Rithika and Max decided to cycle to the camp with Sanketh. Alice brought Mark and Max of [sfpc.school](https://sfpc.school)!

**Sustainability activities**
Sarbani proposed Bamboo tower - we were not sure if we have the needed bamboo in our area (would be funny to bring bamboo from far away as an activity of sustainability). With Subroto's help we figured out the Bamboo in the grooves around was what was needed. Bamboo tower catalysed the LokaLR activity. Video of the making of Bamboo Tower: <https://vimeo.com/799968976>

**Gender**
Jogatis brought in aspiciousness of 3rd gender by ingurating rituals of tower. Community "Rush Crush" cafe by Rashmi. video clip: <https://stories.janastu.org/collection/40/media/985e5d7b-3374-4ef6-9a09-ebd735a6dc27>

Kumabaralli kere (lake) was full - reminiscent of the floods of the past year - which called for a lake time of frolic! While with Tania on a solitary rock as she had received a sad news of a friend that morning. ![](https://anthillhacks.pantoto.net/media/CoP/Kumbaralli%20lake/20221224_091854.jpg)

**LokaLR**
Sarbani had initiated Libre Routers (LR) to be locally made LR in india (calling it LokaLR) as LR is open hardware. Bamboo tower suggests that we can forward the idea of an independent of power grid LR communication node setup: solar power, server, LR node, FX ports, communication setup. Thanks to Mike and Elektra we had a plan of action. Amudan of Wakoma

**CoP Hiure and Tania** - conversations start with Nico on the way back from dwebcamp.
The idea went about how we can pretty much use the same amout of money set for COP, [APC's Communities of Practice](https://communitynetworks.group/c/cops/16), but make it an inperson residency for Hiure and Tania provided they were upto this.
