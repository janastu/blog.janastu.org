##### Description

> ###### libretalk - dedicating to lockdown migrants


> ### Exploring State of Technology to Support Decentralised Ecosystems 

> Course Correction towards Progressive and Local Futures

Starting with a discussion on how education and literacy has lead to the current state of the world - its progressiveness and its regressiveness, we review the state of technology today and the potential for a course correction.

To set the stage, Janastu/Servelots team (Shalini, Bhanu, Sanketh and Dinesh) will share the ongoing activities and experiments towards this, followed by Anupama (*OpenSpaceFoundation.in*) on local governance and Arun Issac (*Systemreboot.net*) on Free software & Linguistics. We open the floor for inputs. To help facilitate inputs by participants, this document ([j.mp/lockdownlibretalk](https://bit.ly/lockdownlibretalk)) will be continously updated.

Marvel of Memory - The flawless method of memorizing the Vedas

"[The Veda, mankind's earliest books were not written, nor engraved in stone.It was preserved by an oral tradition, carried from generation to generation, without a single error.](https://www.rarebooksocietyofindia.org/postDetail.php?id=196174216674_10155801790356675)"

##### Inputs

> Omshivu: 
Education System is badly hit - Time to collate all possible OER's based on region, language and subjects - enable the best teacher to record and make it available for the large. Content on the internet is really not India centric as per my knowledge. This should enable the schools to breath easy than doing disastrous experiments with students. 
*For Teachers*: Time to get adopted to technology usage - OER adoption to curriculum and plan knowledge dissemination.

##### Session Comments


> s k
vedas > brahmins > kshatriyas + vysyas > shudras > dalits > tribals > ...
everybody is enslaved by this "knowledge", for this "knowledge" and of this "knowledge" ðŸ˜›

> Akilesh
Thank you for elaborating. Need to reflect more on agency. Was it 'enslavement' or 'consent'?
> > Arun
In what sense are the Brahmins enslaved?
Aren't they at the top of the caste system?
Ram
The  way I lookat it, was neither, but rather self proclaimed control
>SP MK
Brahmins are the invaders to this land. Buddhist monks were here even before the invasion of Aryans. Chanting is a practice of Buddhist monks in first. At the time of death of Buddha, his followers organised gathering of monks to document the Buddhaâ€™s teachings. There is an alternate history of the marvel of memorising. Please have a look at the history of Buddhism in Indian Landscape. You will get different prospective about the Indian subcontinent.

[d: 
sub-communities who became the knowledge holders we aided/commissioned to carry out that task of "becoming tape recorders for vedas" - thats the "enslavement". they prob are brahmins as this resulted in others having to support them - resulting in caste system. so the brahmins are phase 2 of enslavement that attains a respectable and sacred job activity - like the educated now]

> i guess, all the "local" here means "vernacular" ?

> Akilesh
Which is what makes this talk interesting. A community being co-opted/enslaved/controlling through knowledge through tech! You only hear about how tech ~ power ~ more control. But stating that the creators of tech are themselves enslaved is refreshing. Kind of like the developers of today 'agile'ing their lives away.

> Arun
I think that's a very twisted interpetation
Oppressors are somehow the same as the oppressed?

> SP MK
SK! There is no single source to refer that. I can share the copy of Ambedkar's version. In Tamil There are some versions. if you can read Tamil, I can refer some more materials in Tamil also.

> Akilesh
I think  "How people are enslaved to create knowledge" is indicative of shi* rolls down hill. There is a hierarchy. For sure oppressors is not oppressed. But i though the point was that even creators have limited agency?

> SP MK
There are some copy righted versions Arun. so I suggest some authors so you have look. Ayotheedasa Pandit, he is the first one retrive buddhist history in India.
Ambedkar, â€˜Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Indiaâ€™, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar: Writings and Speeches, vol. 3, pp. 269â€“70. - This one about ambedkars view on Indian History. SK have a look at it. Mayilai Venkatasamy also we can refer arun.
> > Ganesh
i think this lecture series will be of great help :

> priyam
Who does this in the community? Does this need any form of capacity building within community, to use this network and add, share adn use the knowledge on it?
> > s k
yes. it definitely needs a lot of capacity building. this is a Community Operated Wireless (COW) Network 



> Akilesh
I think that is more indicative of how bad the public schooling system is.


> Sankara Pandi MK
Arun this is for you!

> priyam
So on one end we are pushing for education and increasing literacy , basically the current school system... so how do we create the awareness of this kind of knowledge system... do you think there is possibility to intergrate the both, because a total shift will take a lot of time.
Basically, how to change this current aspiration that our society and system has created that the learned is the one who has gone to school or college , the convential education basically

> s k
in a way what we are trying to do is to let communities know that there are platforms where they can "express themselves" and not feel left behind because they are illiterate.

> Arun
> Education system vs Literacy
> 

> priyam
You should also check Ivan Illich's critique on compulsory mass education system

> Faisal - Q?
> Low literate settings & Low technology infrastructure needs, how do communities get quality access to technology. huge learning curve, in deploying and managing networks and infrastructure.
> 

> Arun
When Janatsu says community radio, do you only mean WiFi/raspberry pi based networks? Or do you also mean traditional analog FM radio?


> q
While giving all these technologies, we are demanding time from the communities, same as like the traditional system of Knowledge infusion.  So how is it going to make a difference, unless it is providing a decentralised basic income model for them?

> Arun
I hold an amateur radio license and have some experience with radio equipment. I can help with technical stuff.

> Shreyas
An anecdote from the field - the learning curve is surely steep for the communities. When working with some of the women in Bidar, the term Mesh network was not readily understood but the process of accessing something over wifi was familiar. So at times we need to find a non-tech vocabulary to let communities use. We also used how people share info over conversation was used to explain a network and flow through the network. Worked better but its an on--going effort.

> Priyam
> Are there any interesting readings around cultural economy which you can share?

priyam.. will connect you to someone
