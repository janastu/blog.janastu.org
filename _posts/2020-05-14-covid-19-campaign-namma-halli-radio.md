*Namma Halli Radio, [Namdu 1 Radio](https://www.namdu1radio.com/)* is a platform to Express yourself. With main focus on vernacular local languages and dialects. School students and volunteers help with designing, recording, editing the audio programmes. Then we share this information through public announcements in all the villages.

The main focus of the radio programmes are,
* How to contain the spread of the infection ( maintaining personal hygiene, social distancing at the public places and by staying at home during lockdown)
* Help combat mis-information
* Create educated awareness
* Public talks (invite experts from various fields to share their story in lockdown and spark a conversation)
* Encourage students to broadcast from home.
